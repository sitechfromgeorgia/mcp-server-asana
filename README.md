# MCP Server for Asana

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/%40roychri%2Fmcp-server-asana.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roychri/mcp-server-asana)

This Model Context Protocol server implementation of Asana allows you
to talk to Asana API from MCP Client such as Anthropic's Claude
Desktop Application, and many more.

## Environment Variables

- `ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN`: (Required) Your Asana access token
- `READ_ONLY_MODE`: (Optional) Set to 'true' to disable all write operations. In this mode:
  - Tools that modify Asana data (create, update, delete) will be disabled
  - The `create-task` prompt will be disabled
  - Only read operations will be available
  This is useful for testing or when you want to ensure no changes can be made to your Asana workspace.

## Usage

In the AI tool of your choice (ex: Claude Desktop) ask something about asana tasks, projects, workspaces, and/or comments. Mentioning the word "asana" will increase the chance of having the LLM pick the right tool.

Example:

> How many unfinished asana tasks do we have in our Sprint 30 project?

3. **Installation Options**:

   ### For Claude Desktop:
   Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "asana": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@roychri/mcp-server-asana"],
         "env": {
           "ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN": "your-asana-access-token"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```
   
   ### For Claude Code:
   
   Use the following command to install and configure the MCP server:
   
   ```bash
   claude mcp add asana -e ASANA_ACCESS_TOKEN=<TOKEN> -- npx -y @roychri/mcp-server-asana
   ```
   
   Replace `<TOKEN>` with your Asana access token.

If you want to install the beta version (not yet released), you can use:

* `@roychri/mcp-server-asana@beta`

You can find the current beta release, if any, with either:

1. https://www.npmjs.com/package/@roychri/mcp-server-asana?activeTab=versions
2. `npm dist-tag ls @roychri/mcp-server-asana`

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission errors:

1. Ensure the asana plan you have allows API access
2. Confirm the access token and configuration are correctly set in `claude_desktop_config.json`.

### Test it locally with the MCP Inspector

If you want to test your changes, you can use the MCP Inspector like this:

```bash
npm run inspector
```

This will expose the client to port `5173` and server to port `3000`.

If those ports are already used by something else, you can use:

```bash
CLIENT_PORT=5009 SERVER_PORT=3009 npm run inspector
```
